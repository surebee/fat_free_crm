#\c fat_free_crm_development
# delete from addresses;
# delete from opportunities;
# delete from accounts;
# copy addresses from 'addresses-insert.csv'  using delimiters ',';
# copy opportunities from 'opportunities-insert.csv'  using delimiters ',';
# copy accounts from 'accounts-insert.csv'  using delimiters ',';
# SELECT setval('addresses_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) from "addresses"));
# SELECT setval('opportunities_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) from "opportunities"));
# SELECT setval('accounts_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) from "accounts"));
